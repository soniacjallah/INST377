                My name is Sonia Morgan. I am Howard Community College Alumni and full-time student at the University of
                Maryland,
                College Park, studying Information Science with a focus on Data Science. In addition to
                my studies, I enjoy giving back to my community by using my time and skills to help
                those in need. My current professional interests consist of full stack web developement, project
                management,
                and database developement & administration. My expected graduation date is May 2020. After graduation, I
                aim to
                work full-time in the field of web developement or database administration. Thanks for reading!
