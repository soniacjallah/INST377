                        My name is Sonia Morgan; you can call me Sonia. Here's a little bit about myself: 
                        <br>

                        I am  Howard Community College Alumni and full-time student at the University of Maryland, 
                        College Park, studying Information Science with a focus on Data Science. In addition to 
                        my studies, I enjoy giving back to my community by using my time and skills to help
                        those in need. 
                        <br>

                        My current professional interests consist of full stack web developement, project management,
                        and database developement & administration. My expected graduation date is May 2020. After graduation, I aim to
                        work full-time in the field of web developement or database administration.
                        <br>
