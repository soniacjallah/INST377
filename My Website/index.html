          My name is Sonia Morgan. I am Howard Community College Alumni and
          full-time student at the University of Maryland, College Park,
          studying Information Science with a focus on Data Science. In addition
          to my studies, I enjoy giving back to my community by using my time
          and skills to help those in need. My current professional interests
          consist of full stack web developement, project management, and
          database developement & administration. My expected graduation date is
          May 2020. After graduation, I aim to work full-time in the field of
          web developement or database administration.
